Zucchini Demo
--------------
Rough little work in progress demo of the iOS test automation framework [Zucchini](http://www.zucchiniframework.org/) from Playup!

Still missing some working selectors as Xcode 4.3 and Instruments do not want play nicely with the Simulator =/

Might have to drop back to Xcode 4.2 to finish or get hold of some shiny iphonium hardware =)

Great little demo from Raj helped me get started https://github.com/rajbeniwal/zucchini-demo

And lovely to be working in Coffeescript + ruby to test an iphone app, should hopefully pair well with [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/) in future!
